                Nanaimo and she went above and beyond to stay opened late for
                us. The purchase was so quick and professional. She was
                completely honest about everything and we got ourselves a great
                car for a great deal! She provided all of the cars history and
                facts. We recommend this dealership to anybody looking for a
                vehicle. Thanks Vicki for the great experience and car
